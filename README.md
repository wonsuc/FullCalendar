Questions & Issues

If you are having questions or problems, feel free to contact me. Since I would very much like that other users of this library **can also benefit** from your question, I am asking you to contact me via e-mail **only as a last option**. Instead, you should:

 - Make sure you are using the latest version of the library. Check the [**release-section**](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/releases).
 - Search [**known issues**](https://github.com/wonsuc/FullCalendar/issues) for your problem (open and closed)
 - Create new issues (please **search known issues before**, do not create duplicate issues)
